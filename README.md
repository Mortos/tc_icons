## TrinityCore Icons Recolored
![Sample](sample.jpg)

As simple as that, this repository contains both the original TrinityCore icons and five other new icons recolored, all of them include the sizes:

* 16x16 (now included in the originals)
* 32x32
* 48x48
* 64x64
* 96x96
* 128x128

The color of the icons are:

* Red
* Blue
* Purple
* Green
* Cyan
* Caci
* Orange

Notice that this is something I did a while ago in my spare time and wanted to share it, so don't expect the most polished quality.
